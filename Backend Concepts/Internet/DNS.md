# Terms
**DNS Recursor resolver** - Receive DNS requests from client machines, and job is on the recursor's hands
**Root Nameserver** - Just like an Index to TLD servers, such as .com, .in
**Authoritative nameserver** - Holds the translation for the domain name

# DNS Queries
1. Recursive Queries - The DNS Server(resolver) returns with the requested result or with an Error Message.
2. Iterative Queries - The DNS server returns the requested result or points to other lower level servers (Road Trip)
3. Non-recursive queries - The final query with the authoritative server or the query from the cache
# DNS Caching
DNS data can be cached in variety of locations, with a TTL (Time to live)
1. Browser - check the browser cache atÂ `chrome://net-internals/#dns.`
2. OS level DNS resolver
	1. A OS Process, called **Stub Resolver**, has its own cache.
	2. If cache dont have what the application asked for it sends DNS query to a **DNS resolver** inside the **ISP** with a recursive flag
	3. The **DNS Resolver** inside the **ISP** has its own ***cache***
	4. The DNS resolver does different functionality based on the records it has
		1. if it not have **A Record**s, but has **NS records**, then it'll skip querying **TLD server** and query the **name servers**
		2. if it doesn't have **NS records**, it'll ask for **TLD server** without asking the **Root**
		3. if it doesn't have both, it'll ask for the root server (highly unlikely)

## Records
The entries in a DNS
### A Record 
- A stands for address records.
- A stores IPv4 addresses, and AAAA stores IPv6 address

### NS Record
- NS stands for Name space record
- Indicates DNS Server authoritative for that domain
- The Name server holds all the A Records and MX Records for that domain.
- There is more than on nameserver, so no single point of failure.
