> [!NOTE] Network is devices connected together, the Internet is networks connected together

> The internet is a network of networks.

# How?
- Internet is interconnection between routers, responsible for sharing information.
- There are standardised protocols that defines how it should be shared

- The data will initially broken down to packets, and **examined** by the router and **forwarded** to the next router on its path towards destination.
- The protocols ensure that these data are sent and received correctly, The Internet Protocol (IP) and the Transaction Control Protocol (TCP) 

- IP - Ensures packets reaches the correct destination
- TCP - Ensures packets are transmitted reliably

**Other underlying protocols that involves in data communication**
- [[DNS]] - Translates domain names to IP address
- [[SSL or TLS]] - 
- [[HTTP and HTTPs]] - Application layer protocol, ensures data transmission between clients and servers, on top of the protocol stacks
- [[HTTPS]] - A secure extension of HTTP, encrypts data transmission with SSL/TLS
# The Protocols
> A protocol is a set of rules and standards that define how information is exchanged between devices and systems.
- In Networking, protocols enables standardised communication between devices, so that different devices from different vendors can work together seamlessly.
# SSL/TLS
- It is a protocol, that's used to encrypt data transmitted over internet

**Key Concepts**
- Certificates - 
- Handshakes - 
- Encryption -
