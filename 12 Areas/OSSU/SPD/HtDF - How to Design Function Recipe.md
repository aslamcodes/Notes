- Signature, purpose and stub.
	- signature Number -> Number
	- Purpose - short description what it does for what given input
	- stub - something that fails, exists for short part of time, the fullfills the signature, but not the purpose
- Define examples, wrap each in check-expect.
	- Write test cases the defines the examples of the function execution
	- Run the tests and the stub will fail
- Template and inventory.
	- Define the function without body
- Code the function body.
- Test and debug until correct
