# What is EC2
- For business we need raw computing power
- With AWS, we'll be working with virtual servers for our business, called EC2
- EC2 is resizeable computing capacity
- Unlike on premise, we can have whatever unlimited computing capacity to use whenever we need it. 
- Not necessary to commit to a fixed capacity
- Only pay for what we use
- EC2 runs on top of physical host machine using virtualization technology
# Hypervisor
- The hypervisor is responsible for 
	- sharing underlying resources and
	- coordinating multitenancy and
	- isolating virtual machines
# Flexibility
- Control over config and its state 
## Config
- OS- Windows and linux 
- Apps- Web apps, Databases...
## Networks

# How EC2 Works
- Launch - Config (OS, Application server or applications) and specify security settings to control network traffic and type of instance(hardware)
